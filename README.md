IRC Stats
=========

Monolithic #GreatestGuys IRC logs dating back to February 2013. Logs are
available in an easy to process JSON format and regenerated hourly. Add new
graphs and visualizations by forking on GitHub. New templates will be
automatically pulled in hourly.

Web App
-------

The web app assumes that you have a copy of the log file in the root of your git
checkout.

To add new graphs to the home page edit the `web/templates/index.html` file.
